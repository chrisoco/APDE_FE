## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Campaign Selection Interface** - Searchable dropdown for active campaigns
2. **Statistics Dashboard** - Real-time metrics and progress visualization  
3. **Email Sending Engine** - Backend API integration with safety controls
4. **Progress Tracking** - Visual indicators of campaign coverage
5. **Error Management** - Toast notifications and error display

### Data Flow

```typescript
Campaign Selection → Load Statistics → Configure Options → Send Emails → Update Statistics
```

## Interface Structure

### Main Dashboard

**Location**: `/admin/campaign-outbox`
**Purpose**: Central hub for email campaign management

**Layout Components:**
- Header with title and description
- Campaign selection card
- Statistics dashboard card  
- Sending options and controls
- Progress indicators and error handling

### Campaign Selection

**Component**: `Combobox` with searchable active campaigns
**Behavior**: 
- Filters campaigns to show only `status === 'Active'`
- Loads statistics automatically when campaign selected
- Clears statistics when selection cleared

```typescript
// Campaign filtering logic
const campaigns = allCampaigns.filter(campaign => campaign.status === 'Active')
```

## Statistics System

### Metrics Tracked

The system tracks comprehensive email sending metrics for each campaign:

```typescript
interface SentEmailsStats {
  total_emails_sent: number      // Total emails sent for this campaign
  notified_prospects: number     // Unique prospects who received emails
  available_prospects: number    // Prospects available for sending
  total_prospects: number        // Total prospects matching campaign filter
}
```

### Statistics Dashboard

**Real-time Updates:**
- Statistics load automatically when campaign selected
- Refresh after successful email sending
- Loading states during data fetching

**Visual Elements:**
- **Metric Cards**: Four-column grid showing key numbers
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of campaign coverage
- **Coverage Percentage**: Calculated completion rate

```typescript
// Coverage calculation
const coveragePercentage = (notified_prospects / total_prospects) * 100
```

### Statistics API Integration

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/campaigns/{campaignId}/send-emails/sent`

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "total_emails_sent": 1250,
  "notified_prospects": 950, 
  "available_prospects": 350,
  "total_prospects": 1300
}
```

**Loading Behavior:**
- Non-blocking statistics loading 
- Previous values preserved during refresh
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## Email Sending System

### Sending Workflow

1. **Campaign Validation**: Ensure campaign is selected
2. **Parameter Configuration**: Apply force option if checked
3. **API Request**: Send email request with authentication
4. **Response Processing**: Handle success/error responses
5. **Statistics Refresh**: Update metrics after successful send
6. **User Feedback**: Display toast notifications

### API Integration

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/campaigns/{campaignId}/send-emails`

**Request Options:**
```typescript
{
  method: 'POST',
  requiresAuth: true,
  includeCSRF: true,
  params: forceOption ? { force: true } : undefined
}
```

**Response Format:**
```typescript
interface EmailSendResponse {
  message: string
  emails_sent: number           // Emails sent in this batch
  total_emails_sent: number     // Total sent for campaign 
  notified_prospects: number    // Unique prospects notified
  available_prospects: number   // Prospects still available
  total_prospects: number       // Total campaign prospects
}
```

### Sending Options

**Force Option (`force: true`)**:
- **Purpose**: Allow sending to previously notified prospects
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Resending important updates
  - Following up on campaigns
  - Testing email variations
- **Safety**: Requires explicit user confirmation via checkbox

**Normal Sending (default)**:
- **Purpose**: Send only to prospects not previously contacted
- **Behavior**: Filters out already notified prospects automatically
- **Safety**: Prevents accidental duplicate emails

## Development Environment Controls

### Local Development Safety

**Environment Detection:**
```typescript
import.meta.env.VITE_APP_ENV === 'local'
```

**Development Restrictions:**
- **Normal Send**: Only 1 email sent (for testing)
- **Force Send**: Maximum 3 emails sent  
- **Visual Warning**: Red text warning displayed in UI

**Warning Display:**
```
"For development purpose only one email will be sent and on "Allow duplicate mailing" three."
```

**Purpose:**
- Prevent accidental mass email sending during development
- Allow functionality testing with minimal impact
- Protect against development environment mistakes

## User Experience Features

### Loading States

**Campaign Selection Loading:**
- Statistics dashboard shows loading placeholders
- Previous statistics preserved during refresh
- Non-blocking UI interactions

**Email Sending Loading:**
- Send button shows "Sending..." text  
- Button disabled during sending process
- Loading state prevents duplicate requests

### Error Handling

**Validation Errors:**
```typescript
if (!selectedCampaignId) {
  setError('Please select a campaign')
  return
}
```

**API Errors:**
```typescript
catch (error) {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed to send emails'
  setError(errorMessage)
  toast.error(errorMessage)
}
```

**Error Display:**
- Inline error messages in red destructive styling
- Toast notifications for immediate feedback
- Graceful error recovery without UI corruption

### Success Feedback

**Dynamic Success Messages:**
```typescript
// Singular/plural handling
if (response.emails_sent > 0) {
  toast.success(`${response.emails_sent} email${response.emails_sent !== 1 ? 's' : ''} sent successfully!`)
} else {
  toast.info('No new emails were sent')
}
```

**Immediate Statistics Update:**
- Statistics refresh automatically after successful send
- Progress bars update to reflect new coverage
- Real-time feedback on campaign progress

## Visual Design

### Layout Structure

**Card-based Design:**
- Main sending controls in primary card
- Statistics dashboard in nested card
- Clear visual hierarchy and separation

**Grid Layout:**
```css
/* Statistics grid */
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)  // Desktop: 4 columns
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)  // Tablet: 2 columns  
grid-template-columns: 1fr            // Mobile: 1 column
```

### Progress Visualization

**Progress Bar:**
```typescript
<div className="w-full bg-muted rounded-full h-2">
  <div 
    className="bg-primary h-2 rounded-full transition-all duration-300" 
    style={{ 
      width: `${(notified_prospects / total_prospects) * 100}%`
    }}
  />
</div>
```

**Color Coding:**
- **Primary Blue**: Progress completion
- **Blue Text**: Available prospects (ready to send)
- **Gray Muted**: Background elements and placeholders
- **Red Destructive**: Errors and warnings

### Responsive Design

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Stack statistics cards vertically on mobile
- Full-width send button for easy touch interaction
- Responsive grid layout for statistics

**Touch-Friendly Elements:**
- Large button targets for mobile users
- Accessible checkbox controls
- Clear visual feedback for interactions

## Caching and Performance

### Campaign Data Caching

**Cache Strategy:**
```typescript
return withCache(
  () => apiHelpers.paginated('/api/campaigns'),
  CACHE_TAGS.CAMPAIGNS,
  { ttl: 2 * 60 * 1000, tags: [CACHE_TAGS.CAMPAIGNS] }
)
```

**Cache Benefits:**
- **2-minute TTL**: Balances freshness with performance
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Updates when campaigns change
- **Reduced API Calls**: Faster page loads and better UX

### Statistics Loading Optimization

**Non-blocking Statistics:**
- Statistics load independently of campaign list
- UI remains interactive during statistics loading
- Previous data preserved during refresh

**Intelligent Caching:**
```typescript
// Only load statistics when campaign changes
if (value) {
  loadSentStats(value)
} else {
  setSentStats(null)
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Requirements

**API Security:**
```typescript
{
  requiresAuth: true,        // JWT/session authentication
  includeCSRF: true         // CSRF token for POST requests
}
```

**Access Control:**
- Admin-only access via layout authentication
- Campaign-level permissions (implied)
- CSRF protection for email sending

### Data Validation

**Frontend Validation:**
- Campaign selection requirement
- Error display for invalid states
- Type-safe interfaces for all API responses

**Backend Validation (recommended):**
- Campaign ownership verification
- Prospect filter validation
- Rate limiting for email sending
- Duplicate detection logic

## Integration Points

### Campaign System Integration

**Active Campaign Filtering:**
```typescript
const campaigns = allCampaigns.filter(campaign => campaign.status === 'Active')
```

**Campaign Requirements:**
- Campaign must have `status: 'Active'`
- Campaign should have associated prospects
- Campaign may have prospect filters applied

### Prospect System Integration

**Prospect Filtering:**
- System respects campaign prospect filters
- Tracks which prospects have been notified
- Calculates available prospects for sending

**Statistics Relationship:**
```
Total Prospects = All prospects matching campaign filter
Notified Prospects = Prospects who received at least one email
Available Prospects = Total - Notified (unless force enabled)
```

### Email System Integration

**Backend Email Processing:**
- Queue management for large sends
- Template rendering with campaign data
- Tracking pixel integration
- Bounce and unsubscribe handling

## Error Scenarios and Recovery

### Common Error Cases

**No Campaign Selected:**
- **Error**: "Please select a campaign"
- **Recovery**: User selects campaign from dropdown
- **Prevention**: Button disabled until campaign selected

**Network Errors:**
- **Error**: API connection failures
- **Recovery**: Retry mechanism, error display
- **User Action**: Manual retry via send button

**Backend Errors:**
- **Error**: Server-side validation failures
- **Recovery**: Error message display, form remains functional
- **User Action**: Address error and retry

### Edge Cases

**Zero Available Prospects:**
- **Behavior**: Send succeeds but reports 0 emails sent
- **Message**: "No new emails were sent"
- **User Understanding**: Clear feedback prevents confusion

**Campaign Becomes Inactive:**
- **Behavior**: Campaign disappears from dropdown on reload
- **Recovery**: User must select different active campaign
- **Prevention**: Real-time campaign status checking

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**User Experience Metrics:**
- Time to load campaign list
- Statistics loading time
- Email sending response time
- Error rates by operation

**System Performance Metrics:**

### Monitoring Implementation

**Frontend Metrics:**
```typescript
// Example performance tracking
const startTime = performance.now()
await handleSendEmails()
const duration = performance.now() - startTime
// Track duration for monitoring
```

**Backend Metrics:**
- Email queue processing time
- Database query execution time  
- Email delivery success rates
- Error rates by campaign
